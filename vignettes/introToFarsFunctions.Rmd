#Switching to the data-raw file to run examples!
#Note that links have been placed in the vignettes directory
#to use "accident_YYYY.csv.bz2" files in this vignette!
# Always have these files in your current working directory
# when `interactive()`!
#setwd(system.file("data-raw", package = "wk4package"))
